# AI-Driven-Recruitment-System
Our clients are calling on us for a solution to help them with their hourly positions. Our current scope is not to support: Warehouse workers, technicians, carpenters, machine operators etc. The core reason is we have never figured out a way to outperform indeed and our team doesnt have the bandwidth to support these hourly type positions. That being said we recently heard there is a wave of AI enhanced tools coming to market that we may be able to offer our clients.

I am looking for a recommendation that is someone "Autopilot" where we can turn on a solution that can be monetized either by externally partnering with an affiliate or something we can look on bringing on in house.  

I am looking for someone that is a AI hiring tool expert that can consult us on what exists and potentially help us integrate it and deploy a new product solution to our client base.
================
To address the need for a scalable and monetizable AI hiring solution tailored to hourly positions, here’s a Python-based conceptual implementation that focuses on integrating AI tools for recruitment. This approach includes leveraging AI for candidate sourcing, screening, and assessment while supporting integration with external platforms like affiliate tools.
Python Code for an AI-Driven Recruitment System

This script showcases how an AI-powered recruitment pipeline can work by integrating OpenAI for candidate interaction and external APIs like job boards (Indeed, etc.) for sourcing candidates.
1. Import Libraries

import openai
import requests
from datetime import datetime

# AI API setup (e.g., OpenAI's GPT for interaction)
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# External Job API setup (e.g., hypothetical Indeed API)
INDEED_API_KEY = "your_indeed_api_key"
INDEED_API_URL = "https://api.indeed.com/v2/jobs"

2. Candidate Sourcing

Connect with external job platforms (like Indeed) using their API to pull hourly job postings.

def fetch_candidates(job_title, location):
    """Fetch job candidates from an external API."""
    params = {
        "q": job_title,
        "l": location,
        "limit": 50,
        "api_key": INDEED_API_KEY
    }
    try:
        response = requests.get(INDEED_API_URL, params=params)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            candidates = response.json()["results"]
            return candidates
        else:
            print(f"Error fetching candidates: {response.status_code}")
            return []
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception in fetch_candidates: {e}")
        return []

3. Candidate Screening with AI

Use OpenAI GPT models to analyze candidate resumes and rank them based on relevance.

def screen_candidates(candidates, job_description):
    """Screen and rank candidates using AI."""
    screened_candidates = []
    for candidate in candidates:
        resume = candidate.get("resume", "No resume provided")
        prompt = f"""
        Evaluate the following resume for the job description: {job_description}.
        Resume:
        {resume}
        Rank on a scale of 1-10 with reasoning.
        """
        try:
            response = openai.Completion.create(
                engine="text-davinci-004",
                prompt=prompt,
                max_tokens=150
            )
            score = response.choices[0].text.strip()
            screened_candidates.append({
                "candidate": candidate,
                "score": score
            })
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error screening candidate: {e}")
    return sorted(screened_candidates, key=lambda x: x["score"], reverse=True)

4. Automation Integration

Use Zapier or Make to automate job board posting and candidate notifications.

def automate_posting(job_details):
    """Automate job posting to external platforms."""
    zapier_webhook_url = "https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/your_webhook_id"
    try:
        response = requests.post(zapier_webhook_url, json=job_details)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("Job posting automated successfully!")
        else:
            print(f"Zapier error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error automating job posting: {e}")

5. Candidate Matching and Communication

Send personalized messages to top candidates.

def contact_candidates(top_candidates):
    """Send personalized messages to top candidates."""
    for candidate in top_candidates[:10]:  # Contact top 10
        name = candidate["candidate"]["name"]
        email = candidate["candidate"]["email"]
        message = f"Hi {name}, we think you're a great fit for our role. Please let us know if you're interested!"
        print(f"Contacting {name} at {email} - {message}")
        # Optionally, use an email API like SendGrid here.

6. Run the Pipeline

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Job details
    job_title = "Warehouse Worker"
    location = "New York, NY"
    job_description = "Looking for reliable warehouse workers with basic logistics skills."

    # Fetch candidates
    candidates = fetch_candidates(job_title, location)

    # Screen candidates
    if candidates:
        screened_candidates = screen_candidates(candidates, job_description)

        # Automate job postings
        automate_posting({
            "job_title": job_title,
            "location": location,
            "description": job_description
        })

        # Contact top candidates
        contact_candidates(screened_candidates)
    else:
        print("No candidates found.")

Recommendations for Tools

    External Partnerships:
        Indeed or ZipRecruiter: Integrate their API for sourcing hourly candidates.
        Pymetrics: AI-based soft skill assessments tailored for hiring.
    In-House Solutions:
        Use OpenAI’s GPT for resume screening and candidate communication.
        Develop a custom automation layer with tools like Zapier for workflow streamlining.

Next Steps

    Consultation with AI Recruitment Experts: Engage professionals experienced in tools like HireVue, Eightfold.ai, and SeekOut.
    Deployment: Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) to test with one client segment.
    Monetization: Implement a subscription-based or pay-per-use model for clients.

This system provides a foundation for implementing an AI-driven hiring solution and can be further customized based on specific business requirements.
